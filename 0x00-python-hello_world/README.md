# 0x00 Python - Hello, World

This directory contains Python projects and exercises that focus on introductory concepts in Python programming. Each file corresponds to a specific task or challenge.

## Projects

### Project 0: Run Python file

The goal of this project is to create a shell script that runs a Python script specified by the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### Project 1: Run inline

In this project, a shell script is developed to run Python code stored in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

### Project 2: Hello, print

A simple Python script is created in this project that prints the message "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle."

### Project 3: Print integer

This project involves completing a Python script to print an integer stored in a variable, followed by "Battery street" and a new line.

### Project 4: Print float

The source code must be completed to print a float stored in a variable with a precision of 2 digits.

### Project 5: Print string

The task is to complete a Python script that prints a string stored in a variable three times, followed by its first 9 characters.

### Project 6: Play with strings

The goal of this project is to complete the source code to print the message "Welcome to Holberton School!" without using loops or conditional statements.

### Project 7: Copy - Cut - Paste

In this project, the source code is completed to manipulate a string variable. It involves extracting the first 3 letters, last 2 letters, and the middle part of the string.

### Project 8: Create a new sentence

This project involves completing the source code to print the message "object-oriented programming with Python" without using loops, conditional statements, or creating new variables.

### Project 9: Easter Egg

The task is to write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

### Project 10: Linked list cycle

This project is a technical interview preparation task. It involves writing a function in C to check if a singly linked list has a cycle.

### Project 11: Hello, write

In this advanced project, a Python script is created using the sys module to write a specific message to stderr and exit with a status code of 1.

### Project 12: Compile

A script is developed to compile a Python script file. The Python file name is stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`, and the output filename is `$PYFILEc`.

### Project 13: ByteCode -> Python #1

The task involves writing a Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that performs the same as the provided Python bytecode.


## Requirements

- All Python scripts should be executable.
