## Overview
Welcome to the Python Classes Project! This project is designed to enhance your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Each task focuses on different aspects of creating and manipulating classes, providing practical hands-on experience.

## Project Structure

The project is organised into several tasks, each building on the previous one. Below is a brief overview of each task:

#### Task 0: My first square
In this task, you will create a basic Square class with no attributes. It serves as a starting point to familiarize yourself with class structure in Python.

#### Task 1: Square with size
Task 1 introduces the 'size' attribute to the Square class. You'll define a private instance attribute and initialize it during instantiation. This task lays the foundation for size-related manipulations in subsequent tasks.

#### Task 2: Size validation
Building upon Task 1, Task 2 involves adding size validation to the Square class. You'll ensure that the 'size' attribute is a positive integer, raising appropriate exceptions if invalid values are provided.

#### Task 3: Area of a square
Task 3 expands the Square class by adding a public method to calculate and return the area of the square. This task emphasizes the implementation of class methods for data manipulation.

#### Task 4: Access and update private attribute
In Task 4, you'll implement getter and setter methods for the 'size' attribute. This enhances control over attribute assignment and retrieval while maintaining encapsulation principles.

#### Task 5: Printing a square
Task 5 introduces a method to print the square using the '#' character. The printing behavior varies based on the size of the square, and this task emphasizes the use of instance methods for specific functionalities.

#### Task 6: Coordinates of a square
Building on previous tasks, Task 6 involves adding a 'position' attribute to the Square class. This introduces the concept of managing multiple attributes within a class.

#### Task 7: Singly linked list (Advanced)
Task 7 takes a more advanced approach by introducing a singly linked list. You'll create a Node class and a SinglyLinkedList class, demonstrating the application of OOP concepts beyond basic attribute manipulation.

#### Task 8: Print Square instance (Advanced)
In Task 8, you'll enhance the Square class to allow printing the square instance directly. This involves customizing the 'str' method to control the string representation of the class.

#### Task 9: Compare 2 squares (Advanced)
Task 9 explores the implementation of comparison operators for the Square class. You'll be able to compare two squares based on their areas, demonstrating operator overloading in Python.

#### Task 10: ByteCode -> Python #5 (Advanced)
The final task, Task 10, involves creating a Python class, MagicClass, that replicates the functionality of a given Python bytecode. This advanced task tests your understanding of bytecode and its equivalent Python code.

## Conclusion
By completing these tasks, you'll gain valuable experience in creating, manipulating, and enhancing classes in Python. Each task builds on the previous one, reinforcing your OOP skills and preparing you for more complex software engineering challenges.
