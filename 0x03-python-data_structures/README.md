# Python Data Structures Project

Welcome to the Python Data Structures project! This project focuses on implementing various functions to manipulate lists and tuples in Python. Each task is designed to enhance your understanding of Python's data structures.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Print a list of integers
Implement a Python script (`0-print_list_integer.py`) to print all integers of a list.

### Task 1: Secure access to an element in a list
Write a function (`1-element_at.py`) to retrieve an element from a list securely.

### Task 2: Replace element
Develop a function (`2-replace_in_list.py`) to replace an element of a list at a specific position.

### Task 3: Print a list of integers... in reverse!
Create a function (`3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`) to print all integers of a list in reverse order.

### Task 4: Replace in a copy
Write a function (`4-new_in_list.py`) that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

### Task 5: Can you C me now?
Craft a function (`5-no_c.py`) to remove all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.

### Task 6: Lists of lists = Matrix
Implement a function (`6-print_matrix_integer.py`) to print a matrix of integers.

### Task 7: Tuples addition
Develop a function (`7-add_tuple.py`) that adds two tuples.

### Task 8: More returns!
Create a function (`8-multiple_returns.py`) that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

### Task 9: Find the max
Write a function (`9-max_integer.py`) that finds the biggest integer in a list.

### Task 10: Only by 2
Code a function (`10-divisible_by_2.py`) that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

### Task 11: Delete at
Develop a function (`11-delete_at.py`) that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8.5
- Pycodestyle 2.8.*

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 0x03-python-data_structures
   ```

2. Execute each Python script as needed, e.g.:
```bash
./0-main.py
```

This project is completed as part of the curriculum for the software engineering course offered by ALX Africa, by Refiloe Radebe.
