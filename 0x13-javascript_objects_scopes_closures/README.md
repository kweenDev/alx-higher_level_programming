#Javascript - Objects, Scopes and Closures
### 0x13-javascript_objects_scopes_closures

## Overview

This project covers fundamental concepts in JavaScript such as object creation, scopes, closures, and class inheritance. The tasks are designed to help you understand these concepts better and apply them in practical scenarios.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `0-rectangle.js` to `6-square.js`: Files related to rectangle and square classes.
- `7-occurrences.js` to `10-converter.js`: Utility functions for counting occurrences and number conversion.
- `100-data.js` to `102-concat.js`: Data files and scripts for advanced tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 14.x recommended).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-objects-scopes-closures.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory.
  ```bash
  cd javascript-objects-scopes-closures
  ```
4. Make JavaScript files executable.
  ```bash
  chmod +x *.js
  ```
5. Run the scripts as per task instructions.

## Task List
1. **Rectangle Classes**
	- Create empty and parameterized rectangle classes.
	- Define width and height attributes.
	- Implement methods for printing, rotating, and doubling rectangles.
2. **Square Class**
	- Inherit from Rectangle to create a Square class.
	- Implement methods for specific square operations.
3. **Utility Functions**
	- Count occurrences in a list.
	- Reverse a list without using built-in methods.
	- Convert numbers between bases.
4. **Advanced Tasks**
	- Manipulate arrays using map.
	- Compute dictionaries based on occurrences and user IDs.
	- Concatenate files using a script.

## Usage
- Use `node filename.js` to run JavaScript files.
- Refer to each task's README for detailed instructions.
